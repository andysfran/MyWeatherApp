# My Weather App

This application shows the weather forecast for the current day and the next 7 days.
The app will use your location by default to show the weather forecast but if you won't
allow it will be used Lisbon (Portugal) by default.
This application uses OpenWeather API to fetch the weather forecast so you will need to have an API key.
Check it out [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).
